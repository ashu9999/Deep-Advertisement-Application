# Deep-Advertisement-Application

A Deep learning based application using OpenCV methods for detecting the faces.  
These faces are then classified according to their Gender and Age using RNNs.  
Then the advertisements are shown to the user based on the prediction.  
These ads are fetch from the folder named 25-30 etc.
